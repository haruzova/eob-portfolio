## The Creative Digital Media Sector
### <font color="#7359b3">(I) - Researching and writing my own definition of some job roles within the games industry.</font>
#### <u>Producer</u>
In the games industry, a producer is the person at the top who owns or is in charge of supervising and overseeing a game's development. Their role and level of involvement can vary depending on the project, company, and whether they're an external or internal producer, but this tends to include:
- Ensuring the quality and timeliness of a product
- Managing employees
- Arranging for things such as beta testing
- Handling the budgets
- Negotiating contracts and licensing
#### <u>UI/UX Designer</u>
UI/UX designers in the games industry are responsible for handling the player experience and ensuring the game is constructed in a way that is transparent and easy to use. They tend to do things such as:
- Ensuring the player is getting clear feedback from the game
- Making sure the user interface has a clear visual hierarchy
- Adding accurate and readable labelling to menu or other UI elements
- Giving subtle guidance to stuck players (like death-screen hints)
- Creating easy to navigate menus
#### <u>Technical Artists</u>
Technical artists, or TAs, assist artists in the game development process. They serve as a link between the artists and programmers on the team, and their role tends to involve:
- Developing game engines
- Ensuring the artists have the right software and creating custom tools if needed
- Translating the designs of artists into the game, aiming to keep the final product faithful but efficient
- Using their knowledge of the game engine and its limitations to let the artists know if something is or isn't possible
#### <u>Community Manager</u>
In the games industry, community managers exist to bridge the gap between a game company and its audience; they are the part of the company the player sees most. Some of the things the community manager role typically involve are:
- Running and organising social media pages
- Responding to feedback from audiences
- Representing the company/developers at events
- Writing newsletters and other public-facing content
- Managing online community spaces such as official Discord servers
### <font color="#7359b3">(II) - Explaining what a freelancer is.</font>
A freelancer is someone who is self-employed, and is independently contracted to work on certain jobs for clients on a flexible basis. Instead of working for one employer consistently, a freelance worker tends to go from client to client, working on different tasks, sometimes multiple at the same time.

## Requisites for Work
### <font color="#7359b3">(I) - Applying a S.M.A.R.T target to one of these job roles and setting some goals for what one would need to do to achieve this job.</font>
#### <u>For Software Engineer - </u>[Electronic Arts](https://ea.gr8people.com/jobs/176413/software-engineer?geo_location=ChIJc3FBGy2UcEgRmHnurvD-gco)
Focus on learning a specific software development tool, then apply it effectively in an actual software development project within 2-3 months.

**Specific:**<u></u> Focuses on a specific software development tool.
**Measurable:** Can be measured by using a course to learn the tool, and by the completion of the project.
**Attainable:** In using accessible resources like an online course, the goal is achievable.
**Relevant:** This goal, when completed, would directly develop a skill acquired that is in the desired job's requirements.
**Timely:** The time goal of 2-3 months creates a deadline with some wiggle room. 

## Review
### <font color="#7359b3">Tutor Feedback</font>
Overall, the way Maria has outlined each section of SMART is logical, however does not mention any specific goal, but rather a broad set of rules that would apply to learning -any- software development tool.

I feel that what has been written makes sense, but would benefit from having these set of criteria applied to something more specific, for instance, choosing a specific piece of software, finding a specific set of tutorials to work with, and choosing an appropriate time frame for that set of tutorials to be completed by, plus outlining what could be produced after the skill has been acquired to showcase the targets success.
### <font color="#7359b3">Self Evaluation</font>
I feel that I was somewhat able to create a smart target, I understood well enough to lay out each point, though on evaluation I've found that many aspects could be improved, and overall agree with the feedback received. One primary way this could be achieved is by selecting an actual development tool to focus on, instead of keeping it broad and applicable to multiple options. This would help significantly with the specificity of the goal, and in turn each point could be further improved. With a specific course selected for learning the chosen tool, the goal's time frame could be more effectively measured, as well as its relevance and attainability. If I were to re-do this task, I would need to start with adding specificity and then work from there, researching an actual tool and course to write in.
