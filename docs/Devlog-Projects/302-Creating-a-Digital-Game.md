starting to create character sprite sheets for a 2D platformer in clip studio paint. I was possessed by the spirit of glorble gloopus and he did all the work for me. He's not very good at it

Making a start on the 2D platformer game in unreal engine, except I actually did it like last week and it's in Godot instead because I like it more
It's using the sunnyland asset pack here, but i don t like it much and they don't look good with any of my sprite styles so they will be replaced and tossed into the abyss. I foresee absolutlely no undesirable consequences

Also godot on android has a bug where it'll throw up these errors every time you save ANYTHING for no reason. She's so crazyyyy! Love her !!!

considered changing character sprites so i didnt have to stylise everything in that squimbly ahh art style and to account for a more grounded movement style and the less squishcute theme of the story and world im using for the game. tested out the sprite and some animations. they are goofy rn but just WATCH dude *(spoiler: I don't use this in the end)*
### Distractions & details

we interrupt this program to bring you: learning about blueprints/visual scripting in Unreal (it is not fun)
![](assets/unrealscript2.webp)
If these seem hard to read or understand at this scale, then I have successfully taught you what visual scripting is like with a processing disorder
