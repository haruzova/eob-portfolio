It offered immersive gaming experiences and a huge library of games; the console was extremely popular on release and remains so to this day, being one of the best-selling consoles of all time.</p> <p>The hardware of the PS4 was one of its key selling points on release, being a dedicated gaming console and having impressive graphical capabilities and performance that still holds up well today. Additionally, having that capability at the price point of a home games console gave it incredible value and staying power as a staple console, despite no longer having the most impressive specs overall.</p> <p>The PS4 has an expansive library of high quality exclusive games to play, including popular titles such as God of War, The Last of Us and Uncharted. Alongside exclusives, there is a wide range of other titles available on the console, coming to about 3300 in total; many of these are available as simple digital downloads rather than being solely physical, adding some accessibility but keeping options available for those who prefer physically owning games, something impossible on mobile.</p> <p>The control scheme for the PS4 is quite typical for a home console, using its own DualShock 4 controllers, which offer the nuanced controls of both analog sticks and triggers, the immersive rumble feature that serves as its namesake, as well as a clickable touch-pad for both cursor movement and additional inputs. Despite the simple appearance, the quality and features of the controller add a lot to the PS4, though users may not like the light bar on the front of the controller due to its distracting glow. The PS4 has a number of additional features that give it utility besides gaming. With a PSN account, a PS4 can connect to the internet (wirelessly or through LAN), allowing the user to browse online and use media streaming sites/apps. Overall, the PS4 is a quite universal console, but has more value for those interested in a powerful console that works well for competitive gaming.</p>"},{"location":"LV2-Units/202-Digital-Games-Production/#mobile-platforms","title":"Mobile Platforms","text":"<p>Despite mobile operating systems (Android, iOS etc.) not being designed for gaming as a priority, the mobile gaming industry is extremely large, likely due to the sheer accessibility of mobile as a platform enabling it to draw a uniquely wide audience. Mobile devices are usually packed with other utilities and features already, being designed more for \"everything\" than they are \"gaming\", which is a great plus for those who don't want the inconvenience of needing a whole separate device just to play games. They are uniquely accessible in that not only are most mobile devices highly portable, but most people will already be carrying one around often, making the investment for mobile gaming practically non-existent in some cases.</p> <p>Unfortunately, even expensive and high-end phones and tablets will struggle to compete with dedicated consoles and PC gaming in terms of graphical capabilities, cooling, and overall performance; with battery drain and overheating taken into account, this means that the mobile platform is better suited for games that aren't too hardware intensive. This is reflected quite clearly when looking at some of the most popular mobile games. A large portion of the mobile games market is casual, pick-up-and-play style games, being mostly free-to-play titles that make their profits from ads and in-app-purchases, though there's no shortage of more standard games, especially in recent years with the growing number of indie developers for the platform. The sheer volume of games available on mobile is impressive too, however, the prevalence of low-quality adware games that are made solely to generate revenue makes finding high quality games a lot harder unless they've gained popularity already; the \"hidden gems\" of mobile gaming are really quite hidden, and that can put off users who're looking specifically for such games.</p> <p>Most mobile devices (and consequently, most games) are limited to one main input type, which is the touchscreen. However, some games and devices are also tentatively compatible with Bluetooth controllers such as the Dualshock 4 or Joy-cons, and with the gyroscope built-in on many devices, some limited motion controls are available; and this has even been used to create simple VR games. The touchscreen input is uniquely versatile, and is often used to its full potential by developers creating their own unique control schemes, though it's not suited at all for some games, namely games initially made for consoles or PC.</p> <p>While mobile as a platform for gaming has a lot of potential, it may not be considered the best platform for hardcore or competitive gamers, as most mobile devices aren't designed for gaming, and the few that are offer quite little value when comparing price to performance. For more casual players, mobile is an obvious good choice however, offering few downsides if any, and being hands down the most convenient option for many.</p>"},{"location":"LV2-Units/202-Digital-Games-Production/#nintendo-switch","title":"Nintendo Switch","text":"<p>The Nintendo Switch is a games console developed by Nintendo, offering a unique spin on both handheld and home consoles that makes it stand out as one of a kind, earning its spot as the best selling modern console (as of 2023). What it lacks in performance, it makes up for in its great library of games and versatile design. The titular \"hybrid console\" design of the Switch means that it can act as both a home console and a handheld, being able to swap modes in a matter of seconds. This unique feature sets it apart from other consoles, as it can fill multiple roles while keeping the same games, saves, etc. This, as well as the Switch's support for online and local multiplayer as well as media streaming, gives the console a good quality and quantity of features.</p> <p>The hardware of the Switch is far from as impressive as the standard modern home console, partially as a result of its compact design, though it's not definitively worse, or better than mobile, and would be more ideal for casual users who prefer reliability over high performance. Its own screen's resolution (720p) and TV output (1080p) are both lacking in comparison to the average phone or tablet, and it struggles performance-wise with a number of ports from other consoles. Unlike mobile, however, the Switch is built for games, and handles performance-heavy games a lot better, with significantly less overheating and the option to play docked, thus avoiding battery drain. Though it's not the console for flexing graphical fidelity or FPS, it's not at all bad, and its first-party titles are all perfectly optimised to work with what it has. Like the PS4, the Switch has no shortage of excellent exclusive games, with Nintendo's first-party titles on the console making efficient use of the hardware and each of the different control types, generally being well-received for their quality.</p> <p>The game library of the Switch resembles a mix of both the mobile and PS4 libraries, with some mobile games being available on the platform, but with a vast selection of the more content-rich games you'd find on consoles. The Switch features both its own controllers, and a touch screen, making it the most flexible of the three in terms of control variety. The two Joy-cons provided with the console can be used as two separate controllers for multiplayer, attached to the console for handheld play, or placed in a controller grip to use as a single wireless controller. This degree and ease of choice is unique to the Switch, and greatly enhances play by enabling games to use the controllers in interesting ways. It also has some motion controls, which are mostly only capitalised on by Nintendo's own games, but are still a nice feature to have and when used well. Unfortunately, the Joy-cons don't have analog triggers or sticks, limiting the detail of control players can have, and there are issues with joystick drift that have earned them a reputation, however free repairs/replacements are thankfully offered for such cases.</p> <p>The Nintendo Switch can be seen as a halfway-point between the other two gaming platforms here; a games console that has both the portability and convenience of mobile while keeping a large library of high-quality games like the PS4. While its appeal doesn't quite reach to the hyper-competitive or hyper-casual ends of the spectrum, who may not find value in the hybrid-design feature, it's ideal for anyone in between, even if one already has a home console/mobile device for gaming, and especially so for more social gamers or families due to the ease of local multiplayer.</p>"},{"location":"LV2-Units/202-Digital-Games-Production/#iii-describing-the-characteristics-of-four-different-game-genres-and-giving-examples-of-each","title":"(III) - Describing the characteristics of four different game genres and giving examples of each","text":""},{"location":"LV2-Units/202-Digital-Games-Production/#mmo","title":"MMO","text":"<p>MMO stands for Massive Multiplayer Online, and is a type of game that allows large numbers of players to play together in the same world.

Some infinite runners have no real progression besides increasing the player's knowledge/skill, while others take a roguelike-like approach, with score, experience or collected items used for upgrades that help players achieve higher scores.

Open world, on the other hand, refers to games that give the player freedom to explore and progress in a typically expansive world. Thus, open world sandbox games are those which adhere to both genres simultaneously. This fusion of two genres is common enough that \"sandbox\" on its own is often already assumed to mean \"open world sandbox\", though the two are not inherent to each other.

It's the first name most think of when an open world sandbox is mentioned, and for good reason. First fully released in 2011, and having been developed in Lightweight Java Game Library since 2009, through a combination of its iconic art and graphical style, its simple core game concept that allows for limitless expansion, and regular updates with new features, the game has remained timeless and popular even today. The fact that worlds consist entirely of blocks also lends well to an instantly identifiable style that doesn\u2019t get too far in the way of builders\u2019 visions, and makes a perfect foundation for a sandbox game where building and breaking the environment is involved in most of the gameplay.</p> <p>Even before a new world is created, there are choices to make in how you want your experience to be shaped. Options for difficulty are standard, including a permadeath \u201cHardcore\u201d mode and safe \u201cPeaceful\u201d mode, but you can also select between a Creative or Survival world; Survival introduces a health and hunger bar, resource management, and threats like monsters to create challenge and incentives for different playstyles, while Creative is a true sandbox, with your player having access to every block in the game, godmode, cheats and commands. This mode allows for ultimate creative expression over all else, and that contrast with Survival allows for much more diversity in how Minecraft can be played. Each mode appeals to a different kind of player, so there's something for everyone. There is a story to Minecraft, too; it's not made obvious, but players who are observant and interested can piece together silhouettes of the world's past through subtle hints - a method well suited for a game built upon its thriving community, and once again appealing to a wider range of people.</p> <p>In all game modes, the open-endedness of Minecraft makes itself apparent from the beginning. The fundamental gameplay is simple - build or break blocks, pick up items or blocks to gather supplies, craft new items and tools out of them, use tools to better fend off enemies - but the things players can achieve with them are infinite. You're essentially dropped in a vast, largely undisturbed world, without being explicitly told the \"correct\" thing to do, and there are already multiple options available to you. In Survival, there is some more structure; ideally, you want to gather resources and make a base, but otherwise you can completely neglect the common goal of \u201cbeating\u201d the game forever, and still not be playing Minecraft incorrectly, and this is what gives it so much of the replay value that keeps it interesting after over a decade.</p> <p>A downside of all of that choice however, is that it can overwhelm new players, and there are some issues with newbies and especially younger beginners being totally lost on what to do without just relying on other players; thankfully, some decent tutorials are still made accessible, helping resolve this to a degree. After getting your initial bearings through tutorials, the open-ended gameplay becomes easier to navigate and the rest of the game can shine, though there are still some opaque mechanics that are tricky to understand without the community\u2019s help.</p>"},{"location":"LV2-Units/205-Meeting-a-Digital-Media-Brief/#pikmin","title":"Pikmin","text":"<p>Pikmin (2001) is a real-time strategy game published by Nintendo for the Gamecube system, which would later re-release for the Wii in 2009. With a captivating premise, unique gameplay, and a blend of cartoonish, quirky, and grounded atmospheres accented by the memorable design Nintendo games are often known for, the game soon gained a diverse cult following and became the first in an iconic series that is still ongoing today. </p> <p>In Pikmin, you play as Captain Olimar, an employee of Hocotate Freight, who is on intergalactic vacation before his ship, the S.S. Dolphin, is struck by a comet. Having crash landed on an undiscovered planet only known as PNF-404, with his ship destroyed and its missing parts scattered all across the planet, Olimar discovers a species of animal-plant hybrid he names Pikmin along with the ship-like lifeforms, or Onions, that they come from, and must recruit them to help retrieve each component and escape the planet before his life support system runs out. The story is told in an immersive-feeling way, mostly told through Olimar\u2019s journal entries at the end of the day where he writes his thoughts and feelings about the situation, sometimes commenting on the particular events that happened during the prior day, and the player\u2019s ability to complete the game\u2019s objectives will have an effect on how the ending plays out.</p> <p>As the player, you are given a 30-day time limit to build up your squad of Pikmin, face the hostile wildlife, and find the missing 30 ship parts. The gameplay involves exploring different areas, leading your Pikmin to complete various tasks by throwing or rallying them - defeat enemies, break down walls, carry back the lost ship parts, bring food to the Onions to sprout new Pikmin, etc. At the end of a day, Olimar and all Pikmin must enter low orbit around the planet to avoid the nocturnal threats, meaning all Pikmin have to be near the Onions or with Olimar at the end of the day in order to survive the night. There are three types of Pikmin, too, each with their own unique benefits - Red Pikmin deal more damage and are immune to fire, Yellow Pikmin can carry bombs and be thrown to high places, and Blue Pikmin can traverse watery areas safely. Keeping your Pikmin alive, recuperating losses, and using the different types effectively are all necessary skills the player learns over time, to keep ahead of the looming 30 day limit.</p> <p>Where most real-time strategy games feature the player as an almost godlike spectator above the world, controlling and watching everything from a distance, Pikmin instead opts to place the player directly in the world, personally controlling Olimar as he then leads the Pikmin forward to explore and complete each task. This limitation to Olimar\u2019s perspective creates more emphasis on needing to plan your moves efficiently, as you can only be in one place at one time, and allows the player to connect better with his story, which is a significant aspect of the game. The environment design achieves a similar end; the setting of PNF-404 puts the player in an ant's-eye view of what is implied to be a post-apocalyptic Earth - this way, Pikmin puts the same unique and refreshing spin on its environments as it does for gameplay.  by taking a realistic portrayal of our natural world and mixing in the game's own quirks and style through strange creatures like the Pikmin, then combining that with the player's shrunk-down perspective, it takes something familiar, then alters and recontextualizes it just enough to allow the world to feel just as alien to the player as it would be to Olimar.</p> <p>Despite all the positives, Pikmin was still the first of its kind, and came with some balancing issues. Out of the three types of Pikmin, some are better designed for than others. Red Pikmin are the most useful overall with their fighting power and protection against one of the quickest-killing hazards in the game, and there are a good number of areas that only Blue Pikmin can handle, but Yellow Pikmin get the short end of the stick. They only show their usefulness by taking down tough walls or enemies with bombs or grabbing a few high-up parts, both of which only require a few Pikmin. For this reason, most players only really find themselves using Reds and Blues, making the gameplay a little less diverse. </p> <p>Pikmin is also considered on the difficult side - namely for new players, with the 30-day time limit proving too stressful for some. This is also likely the reason a strict day limit was never reintroduced to the series. Some enemies and hazards in the game exacerbate the difficulty, with foes such as the Wollywogs and Smoky Progg being able to wipe out massive amounts of Pikmin at a time.

Developed by Clover Studio and published under Capcom, the game has long been highly praised despite poor initial sales, eventually receiving HD ports to modern platforms, signifying the game's long-standing legacy as one of gaming's masterpieces.</p> <p>The visual style of \u014ckami is what stands out the most upon first glance; it's no understatement to say that each frame looks like a painting. Bold, flowing brushstrokes both foreshadow and call back to the player's own Celestial Brush ability, in such a way that the player naturally sees every environment as a canvas. Despite the cel-shaded, ink-brush look originating from necessity, what with the hardware limitations of the PS2, it's the absolute opposite of a detriment to the game, giving the game its identity, inspiring the setting and narrative, and serving as the key factor that ties together the contrasting elements of the world without losing cohesion. Rather than adapting the otherworldly into something realistic, \u014ckami opts to do the opposite. The beasts and gods all get to be just as fantastical as in the folk tales they're from, because even the flowers and trees get to share that style - reducing realism yet creating immersion at the same time.</p> <p>Players follow \u014ckami Amaterasu, a wolf incarnation of the Shinto sun goddess, as she is awakened from her century-long dormancy to restore balance to a world gripped by an ancient evil known as Orochi; a terrible eight-headed serpent who, once sealed away, has returned. The game takes players through various regions in Asuka period Nippon (Japan), as Amaterasu discovers the extent of that great curse which ravages the land, uncovers the truth behind Orochi's power, while meeting countless unique characters along the way, who each their own role in the story. One such character is her companion Issun, who plays a pivotal role while also bringing a lot of light-hearted moments and humour. Inspired by the story of \"Issun-b\u014dshi\", or \"One-sun Boy\", Issun is an inch-tall wandering artist much too smug for his size, who tags along with Amaterasu (or \"Ammy\" as he calls her), at first only aiming to learn the Celestial Brush techniques alongside her, but becoming more and more helpful as the story goes on. Neither \u014ckami's story nor gameplay are truly complete without the cast of NPCs, as Amaterasu has long been asleep and will need the help of both gods and mortals on her journey to become as powerful as she once was. Each Celestial Brush technique the player gains must be learned from various other gods across Nippon, and although ordinary beings don't recognise Amaterasu, thinking of her as merely a wolf, it's still possible to assist them and earn their praise, which takes the form of a currency used to gain valuable in-game upgrades.</p> <p>Much of \u014ckami's gameplay is modelled after The Legend of Zelda, with a combination of puzzle-solving, exploration, platforming, and combat, while adding its own unique twist with the Celestial Brush skill. Once received, this mechanic opens up a realm of possibilities, which only expands further with each brush technique Amaterasu learns over the course of the game. Using Celestial Brush pauses the game, pulling the screen away and framing it as like a canvas, which the player can paint on to activate different abilities, create objects, and solve puzzles. For instance, drawing a circle in the sky when it's dark will summon back the sun and make it day once more, and drawing a sharp line across an object or monster can slice it in half. This feature alone does wonders to make \u014ckami's gameplay memorable, with how versatile and easy to understand it is and how well the game's design is made to compliment it; the game doesn't have to prompt players for every use of the brush, because it's always available and easy to experiment with, so players become accustomed to using each technique on their own, creating a natural sense of progression.</p> <p>Overall, \u014ckami is a game with incredible polish, with its gameplay, design, and narrative all being excellent, it's hard to find something to dislike. Depending on the platform being played on and the player's individual tastes, some may find the controls for executing the Celestial Brush techniques quite finicky, especially for those using motion controls. Thankfully, the gameplay doesn't often demand too much precision in that aspect.</p>"},{"location":"LV2-Units/205-Meeting-a-Digital-Media-Brief/#iv-answering-questions-about-my-own-game-relating-to-its-intended-demographic-budget-and-resources","title":"(IV) - Answering questions about my own game relating to its intended demographic, budget, and resources.","text":"<p>In terms of intended destination and market, I aim to have this game appeal to fans of the 2D puzzle-platformer genre, and those interested in the combination of exploring and puzzle solving in games.

Was it difficult, did you find certain parts frustrating? or did you find it fairly easy to get to grips with? Why? - I found using the 2D Game Kit not overwhelmingly difficult but not easy either; I struggled with learning how to use certain parts effectively, and level design was a challenge when I was still only getting to grips with using the provided tools, leading to a lot of discarded levels and ideas.</p> <p>Do you agree with the feedback received from your tutor, and why? - I think the feedback I received was overall accurate, as the task was completed and there was some variety of game mechanics on display, though there is also room for improvement. The criticisms about needing more decorations or enemies, and only having one level are some I share, and ideally I would add these to make the experience better.</p> <p>If you were to do this task again, would you do anything differently, and why? - If I were to redo this project, I might start by mapping out the ideas I have on paper, and use it as a reference so that I don't forget, or get lost and not know how close I am to finishing the level, and so that I can work faster to have more time to add things such as decorations and better visual elements.</p> <p>What skills could you work on gaining/improving in order to to engage with this project better? Briefly - how would you go about acquiring these skills, and why these skills? - The skills I think would be most useful for doing projects like this in the future are understanding more game/level design concepts, and how to better use Unity to make use of the tools and options it provides. This is because a lot of the things I struggled with were related to not knowing Unity well, or not understanding how something may feel to play without using trial and error. These could be acquired by looking at tutorials/explanations/videos on the topics, or by actively practising creating more levels in Unity.</p>"},{"location":"LV2-Units/207-Making-a-Website/","title":"207 - Making a Website","text":""},{"location":"LV2-Units/207-Making-a-Website/#navigation","title":"Navigation","text":"<ul> <li>Key Concepts</li> <li>Creating a Website</li> <li>Review</li> </ul>"},{"location":"LV2-Units/207-Making-a-Website/#key-concepts","title":"Key Concepts","text":""},{"location":"LV2-Units/207-Making-a-Website/#i-researching-and-defining-some-key-terms-relating-to-websites","title":"(I) - Researching and defining some key terms relating to websites.","text":""},{"location":"LV2-Units/207-Making-a-Website/#url","title":"URL","text":"<p>This stands for Uniform Resource Locator.

A lot of planning is involved in this animation type compared to others, as it's harder to go back and fix past frames individually, and in big scenes with a lot of moving parts, multiple people would have to work on different parts of a scene.

It is an essential part of creating natural and expressive movement. As an example, when animating a person jumping, a good use of squash and stretch would exaggerate the movement by 'squashing' the character horizontally during the build up to and recovery from the jump. This would make for a more 'bouncy' feeling in the jump, as opposed to stiff and robotic movement. Squash and stretch itself can fall somewhat into the principle of exaggeration, since most uses of it couldn't happen in real life, but it's applied anyway in order to avoid the stiffness that can come with life-accurate movement, and provide clarity to actions, movement and emotions.</p>"},{"location":"LV2-Units/209-Animation/#straight-aheadpose-to-pose-action","title":"Straight Ahead/Pose to Pose Action","text":"<p>There are generally two different ways to draw an animation - these are straight ahead action and pose to pose. The former refers to animating frame by frame, one step at a time in a mainly chronological manner. Pose to pose instead refers to animating using different key frames, then going back and drawing in-betweens. It's common to use both in tandem when animating, since each has their own benefits and downfalls and the preferable option for all the different parts of an animation is rarely just one. Straight ahead animation is best used to achieve fluid and natural movement, being especially useful for fast-paced scenes such as moments of action or frantic movement; though there is more risk of losing track of consistency like proportions and timing, so isn't as popularly used in longer or more complicated scenes. Forgoing doing everything chronologically, pose to pose benefits from it's use of planning out scenes beforehand to be a lot more consistent and easier to fix movement afterwards, seeing plenty of use in complex and drawn out scenes where composition really matters. However, it's not often desirable for those loose and spontaneous actions.</p>"},{"location":"LV2-Units/209-Animation/#slow-inslow-out","title":"Slow In/Slow Out","text":"<p>Slow in and slow out as a principle of animation is the tuning of acceleration and deceleration of movement. Most natural movements are never completely linear; they often start slowly, pick up movement midway, then slow to a stop at the end. By replicating this in animation, something that can be achieved through using more frames for the start and stop of a motion and fewer for the middle, an animator can quickly make their movements more realistic and pleasing to the eye. This principle is particularly helpful to remember when creating impactful movements that the viewer can easily track with their eyes, as the slow in aspect can serve as its own kind of anticipation - and using slow in slow out in tandem with anticipation is what prevents motions from being so sudden the viewer can't process it. Additionally, exaggerating your use of this principle can create stylised and striking motions as opposed to keeping a wholly predictable, flat speed, helping keep visual interest.</p>"},{"location":"LV2-Units/209-Animation/#creating-animations","title":"Creating Animations","text":""},{"location":"LV2-Units/209-Animation/#i-making-an-animation-of-a-bouncing-ball-using-one-of-the-5-types-of-animation-and-employing-the-squash-and-stretch-principle","title":"(I) - Making an animation of a bouncing ball using one of the 5 types of animation and employing the \u2018Squash and Stretch\u2019 principle.","text":"<p>b o i o i o i n g</p>"},{"location":"LV2-Units/209-Animation/#ii-using-the-knowledge-acquired-from-the-ball-bounce-and-reference-footage-to-create-a-walk-cycle","title":"(II) - Using the knowledge acquired from the ball bounce and reference footage to create a walk cycle.","text":""},{"location":"LV2-Units/209-Animation/#process","title":"Process","text":"<ol> <li>Basic Movement</li> <li>Structure + Forms</li> </ol> <ol> <li>Final Sketches</li> <li>Cleanup &amp; Linework</li> </ol>"},{"location":"LV2-Units/209-Animation/#finished-product","title":"Finished Product","text":"<p>+Colour and textures </p>"},{"location":"LV2-Units/209-Animation/#iii-using-the-knowledge-acquired-from-the-walk-cycle-along-with-reference-footage-to-create-a-run-cycle","title":"(III) - Using the knowledge acquired from the walk cycle along with reference footage to create a run cycle.","text":""},{"location":"LV2-Units/209-Animation/#process_1","title":"Process","text":"<ol> <li>Basic Movement</li> <li>Structure + Forms</li> </ol> <ol> <li>Scale to target resolution</li> <li>Final shapes and colours</li> </ol>"},{"location":"LV2-Units/209-Animation/#finished-product_1","title":"Finished Product","text":"<p>+Details and shading </p>"},{"location":"LV2-Units/209-Animation/#review","title":"Review","text":""},{"location":"LV2-Units/209-Animation/#tutor-feedback","title":"Tutor Feedback","text":""},{"location":"LV2-Units/209-Animation/#bouncing-ball","title":"Bouncing Ball","text":"<p>Maria has done a good job utilising the squash and stretch principle here, and has also taken time to add colour and shading in greyscale, which adds a subtle hint of depth to the ball as an object.</p>"},{"location":"LV2-Units/209-Animation/#walking-animation","title":"Walking Animation","text":"<p>Maria has gone above and beyond with the walking animation.

Where other types of media may utilise pixel art primarily for the blocky aesthetics or to achieve a retro vibe, game creation tends to call for a large number of moving parts and assets, which all need to fit well with each other and be fairly easy to replace or change, all things that make pixel art an ideal choice.

Level design refers to the process of creating areas, or 'levels', in games. This is a strategic kind of design, where one has to make sure someone playing their game is going to understand the level they've been put in. Many different methods are used to construct good levels, like arranging objects in an area to lead the eye and gently inform the player of what a specific location means, using bright colours to signal an exit or important items, or subtly discouraging the player from places they can't enter. This is vital for game design as exploring and interacting with levels is the primary way your players are going to experience your game - particularly in level-centric games like Super Mario or those that heavily feature exploration, the design of levels can make or break a game.</p>"},{"location":"LV2-Units/210-Creating-Digital-Art/#ii-describing-and-defining-the-different-elements-of-art","title":"(II) - Describing and defining the different elements of art.","text":""},{"location":"LV2-Units/210-Creating-Digital-Art/#line","title":"Line","text":"<p>One-dimensional marks that span a space between two points.

The process can be compared to traditional sculpting, with tools that push, pull, and add or remove \"material\" from the mesh as though it were clay.</p> <p>One disadvantage this can have in the character creation department is that the high poly count and generally unoptimised topology means that you'll likely need to re-topologise afterwards, to make sure the character's model won't be too resource intensive and can be properly deformed when rigged and animated. But the ability to create detailed organic shapes and models with relative ease and quickly \"sketch\" out your idea before making the final topology may more than make up for that; particularly for complex animal characters whocould prove confusing to poly model from scratch.</p>"},{"location":"LV3-Research/315-Character-Modelling/#re-topology","title":"Re-topology","text":"<ul> <li>Software: Blender, Maya, Modo, or any 3D poly modelling software.</li> </ul> <p>Re-topology, or retopo for short, is a process that aims to optimise and \"clean up\" the mesh of a 3D model, typically because it is unoptimised, has messy topology, or has an unideally high poly count. Retopo uses poly modelling tools to essentially trace over the original model while keeping good topology in mind at all times, creating a version of the model that superficially appears the same, with the difference being that the mesh is better optimised and a lot easier to work with when texturing, animating, rigging, etc. This can also be used to make different versions of the same model with various poly counts, which is useful for game optimisation tricks such as using low poly versions of models when a character is far away.</p> <p>Retopo can be a pretty important step in 3D character modelling; if the initial model has bad topology or was sculpted with a lot of polygons, retopologising can easily be the difference between a model that can be made game-ready without issue, and one that deforms strangely when animated, is unnecessarily hard to texture, or causes performance issues. Taking the time to \"remake\" a model like this can feel redundant though, and for those who sculpt their models, it means spending time learning two different 3D skills to competence which is unideal and quite slow to start. In poly modelling, it's better to avoid having to retopologise at all, since it is usually possible to create good topology the first time with enough understanding and skill. That said, retopo can save a lot more time and stress, especially in game development where most character models are going to be UV'd, textured, rigged, animated, and real-time rendered; and even if the initial model has great topology, it can speed up the process of making lower poly versions significantly.</p>"},{"location":"LV3-Research/315-Character-Modelling/#uv-texturing-skins","title":"UV &amp; Texturing (Skins)","text":""},{"location":"LV3-Research/315-Character-Modelling/#i-briefly-explain-what-uv-unwrapping-is-and-why-it-is-important-for-when-you-want-to-add-textures-to-a-3d-model","title":"(I) - Briefly explain what UV unwrapping is, and why it is important for when you want to add textures to a 3D model.","text":"<p>UV unwrapping is a process that involves unfolding the mesh of a model by cutting it in particular ways in order to flatten it into a 2D shape or \"UV map\".

They are not really designed to be something the viewer can easily look for; rather being something you think about when creating your own animations (or in the case of appeal, character designs). Even disregarding the fact that some of the 12 Principles simply do not apply to 3D animation, to explain \"how each of the principles are being applied\" in a single, short clip of an already-finished movie borders on Sisyphean. Instead, I've chosen to focus primarily on those that are applicable and observable.</p> <p>Staging is one of the most noticeable principles at play here. In the first shot where Buzz first jumps, the perspective used makes every object appear to point to the upper middle of the frame, naturally drawing the eye there. Additionally, the blank ceiling makes the movement even clearer and gives him a clear silhouette, which when combined with the slow in/slow out that is used to build anticipation for his fall (which displays both timing and exaggeration), makes it appear for a moment as though he is flying. The appeal that Disney/Pixar used in their character designs is highlighted here, as the striking plane-like silhouette of Buzz as a character is what helps this scene make the references it does.</p> <p>Something similar is done in the next shot, albeit more subtle. The way this shot is staged gives the appearance of a compositional \"visual floor\" full of large, dark and static background elements that the viewer won't pay much heed, contrasted with the emptier and brighter top-right sections of the image. This is the area Buzz will mostly move through, and so the lack of clutter here once again allows that movement to appear much clearer. This kind of staging can be seen in a lot of action or quick-moving scenes, not only in this scene, and not only in Toy Story, but it's quite nicely demonstrated here.</p> <p>A neat camera/staging trick is also used to connect the two shots even though they are completely different angles; note that when Buzz jumps in the first shot, he moves upwards across the screen in an arc, and as he moves off screen he moves down and right, which is the same angle and direction he maintains in the second shot, perfectly following through that arc and maintaining the momentum. All of this combines into a scene where the viewer's eye naturally follows Buzz between cuts and up into the next shot. It's also worth noting that the aforementioned combination of slow in/slow out, anticipation, timing and exaggeration are used in this shot too, as Buzz slows down while in contact with the ball to once again use timing to exaggerate the force and weight behind the motion and build anticipation for the proceeding bounce.</p> <p>Brief discussion of the principles that were not mentioned: - Squash and stretch is indeed being used, but that's about it. The ball squashes as Buzz lands on it and stretches slightly once he bounces off, establishing through cartoonish clarity how bouncy said ball must be. It's not ground-breaking, unless by \"ground-breaking\" you're referring to the fact that it's the first 3D bouncy ball Disney made.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Secondary action is visible in the first shot, although subtle; while Buzz's primary action, his jump, is ongoing, there is also a secondary action involving his arms, which spread out before moving to a diving pose. This secondary action doesn't simply work to create a natural feeling movement, but also subtly emphasises different parts of the motion. I've previously discussed how timing, silhouettes, etc. were used to give viewers a momentary impression that Buzz is flying, before subverting that expectation and instead turning it into a dive, and this is once again reinforced in the secondary action here. Though secondary action isn't supposed to take the front and centre, it has an equally important role in helping silently tell the story of a scene.</p> </li> <li> <p>Follow-through/overlapping action can be seen quite clearly in the second shot. Here, Buzz stops falling, but his arms continue to move and spin around, reminding the viewer how Buzz is indeed a toy with ball joints, and interacts with physics as a toy would. This can be seen throughout all of Toy Story; it can be considered part of the appeal of the toy characters and setting, and is able to simultaneously gives a sense of physical realism while still being a deeply cartoonish exaggeration of a typical character movement.</p> </li> <li> <p>There are no solid drawings in Toy Story. They were surely used in the 3D modelling process, but they are not at all observable here.</p> </li> <li> <p>Straight ahead/pose-to-pose is a term that really only refers to 2D animation, and is also simply unobservable. Perhaps the animators really did move Buzz frame-by-frame like their 2D division drew every animation cel, but unless Disney P. Ixar himself descends upon my workstation this very moment with a message, we shall never know.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"LV3-Research/319-Creating-3D-Digital-Animation/#key-frames","title":"Key Frames","text":""},{"location":"LV3-Research/319-Creating-3D-Digital-Animation/#i-explain-what-key-frames-are-and-how-they-are-useful-when-creating-animations","title":"(I) - Explain what key frames are and how they are useful when creating animations","text":"<p>Key frames are an important step in the 3D animation workflow, where a selection of 'landmark' frames are created (this is also part of the blocking process) to outline the broad strokes or key poses in a movement, before the rest of the frames are then procedurally added in between (literally called in-betweens) to create the final animation.

NPCs and players are always moving around in relative position to each other, and creating a separate animation for every possible angle and situation would range from extremely tedious to impossible, not to mention the hit to performance. Rather than do that, game devs instead use procedural animation to manipulate the relevant bones to make the NPC face where they're supposed to. </p> <p>Another ideal example would be the infamous ragdoll physics. When players or enemies fall over and/or die, it's not uncommon to see them suddenly flail or go limp, interacting with all the level collision on the way down. This too is done with procedural animation, and looking at different implementations of ragdoll physics is a great way to observe how fully procedural animations can either look super realistic or completely unnatural. The more realistic implementations of ragdoll physics will impose certain limits on the movement range of each bone to mimic how real bodies work, while a more cartoony or silly game might freely ignore such rules, and let the natural jank of the physics simulation take over, or take steps to ensure the animation always looks exaggerated.</p> <p>Procedural animation is also used for things like walk cycles and interaction with objects, such as if a character needs to walk over rocky terrain, go up some stairs, or pick up an item from the environment. Solely using baked animations for these actions could result in the character's hands or feet clipping into the world or missing the target object entirely, but through procedural animation, you can use code to determine the correct placement for the character's feet/hands, and use IK chains so that the bones controlling their legs/arms will move accordingly.

While the difference used to be more pronounced back when mastering was necessary in making a playable final product, the main and most salient distinction today is that of how close to completion the project is. Mixing is the first step after recording/composing, and involves making much more dramatic changes. It's here where the song gains 99% of its signature sound, and some preparations are typically made here to reduce the amount of time spent on mastering, such as testing the mix on different headphones while working. Mastering on the other hand is the final step, always done at the tail end of production and involving less drastic alterations.
